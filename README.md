## Project Overview: Boston House Price Predictor

The **Boston House Price Predictor** is a machine learning project developed to estimate the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs. Leveraging the well-known Boston Housing dataset, this project demonstrates the complete workflow for a regression problem, including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.

### Key Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize key attributes of the Boston Housing dataset to understand relationships and identify influential factors affecting house prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data, handle missing values (if any), and perform feature scaling to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Implement and compare various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model predictions using suitable evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
- **Deployment (Optional)**: (If included) Provide scripts or notebooks for deploying the trained model as an interactive application or API.

### Dataset

The project uses the classic **Boston Housing dataset**, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. Key features include:

- CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
- ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- TAX: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)² where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town
- LSTAT: % lower status of the population
- MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's (target variable)

### Project Structure

- **Data Exploration**: Initial investigation of the dataset, visualization of feature distributions and correlations.
- **Preprocessing**: Handling of data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling**: Training and evaluating multiple regression models.
- **Results**: Comparison of models and selection of the best-performing one.
- **Prediction**: Making predictions on unseen data.

### Results

- The best-performing model (e.g., Random Forest) achieved an R² score of XX on the test set, indicating strong predictive capability.
- Feature importance analysis highlighted that variables such as RM, LSTAT, and PTRATIO are significant predictors of house prices.

### Acknowledgements

- The Boston Housing dataset is a classic dataset and is available in the `sklearn.datasets` library.
- This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for solving a regression problem in machine learning.
